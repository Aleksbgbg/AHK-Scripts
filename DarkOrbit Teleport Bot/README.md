# DarkOrbit Teleport Bot
A bot for DarkOrbit, which travels the player from the home map to the next map, and then teleports back, in an attempt to be teleported to the Easter egg map.

This program is the original, AutoHotKey version, which was later translated to AutoIt3, found at this [repository](https://github.com/Aleksbgbg/DarkOrbit-Teleport-Bot).
